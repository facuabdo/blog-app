Challenge Malana 3

Built with AngularJS 1.8.2, UI-Router, Bootstrap. I chose to build it using AngularJS instead of Angular2+ because I am way more familiar with this version and I believe it will tell more about my capabilities than a poor, modern-framework-based app.

NodeJS is required to run this project. It was tested with the latest LTS version (14.17.6)

The following commands need to be executed:

npm i -g gulp<br>
npm i<br>
gulp server
